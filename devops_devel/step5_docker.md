I have an idea, let's use containers.

Let's get a server up and running!

The repo you've cloned contains a Dockerfile, have a look at it.

You have to:
1. Create an image called "test" using the provided Dockerfile
2. Run the new image so that it is:
    - Listening on port 80
    - Running in the background
3. Check the page is being served
4. Show the logs from the running container

Bonus question:
- Show the environment vars that the running container is using
